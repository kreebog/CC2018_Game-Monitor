Game Server Monitor for Code Camp 2018


## Tips

1. After Cloning
2. npm install typescript --global
3. npm install nodemon --global
4. copy the .env file I emailed you into the project root directory
5. Edit .env file as needed to set the correct service/server URLs and Ports
6. Set the global logging level using the LOG_LEVEL value in the .env file

## Running Locally (during dev)

1. Open two terminal windows
2. First window: type 'tsc --watch' (auto compiles typescript files on save)
3. Second window: type 'npm run watch' (starts nodemon, which will restart your app every time a code file saves)
